# JayBeta - Todo List React Hook

## üìò Lessons Learned
* Takehome message: 
<ol>
<li>eventHandlers take care of initiating the function via user interaction, there is no need to use useEffect method</li>
<li>We usually return the new array/object with updated state and/or styling of items instead of returning one single item/styling condition in the array/object</li>
</ol>

## ü§ê Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* Styling does not work after we check the todo checkbox because <code>props.item.completed</code> is updated by <code>handleChange()</code> method within the scope of <code>addtodo</code> child component only. The updated state by <code>handleChange()</code> method is not passed down to grandchild compopent <code>todoitem</code>.

The item object has 3 keys: id, text, completed. Completed key is set false by default which is its initital state within <code>addtodo</code> child component.

After clicking on the checkbox of the first item idexed 0 (see the image), its key <code>completed</code> turned <code>true</code> in the new array returned by <code>handleChange()</code> method within <code>addtodo</code>. This new state is not passed down to <code>&lt;TodoItem /&gt;</code> in other words, the updated properties of <code>todoList</code> array is not mapped  down to props BECAUSE <code>todoList</code> state is not updated by <code>setTodoList</code>. WHY?

Previously, setTodoList takes a function as an argument:

<pre>
    const handleChange = (id) => {
      setTodoList(() => { todosData.map(item => {
                          if (item.id === id) {
                            item.completed = !item.completed
                          }
                        return item;
                        })
                        return todoList;
                  })
                };
</pre>

In order for setTodoList to work, the argument has to be an object which is the todoList array. You do not need to return todoList when you already uses <code>map</code> method

<pre>
setTodoList(todoList.map(item => {
                          if (item.id === id) {
                            item.completed = !item.completed
                          }
                        return item;
                        })
                  )};
</pre>

<code>setTodoList()</code> now returns updated state for each items (here is 5 items). But the styling still does not work. As in the instruction of Scrimba (Reactjs), the styling must be done in the child component, not the parent. However, since the style depends on the state of <code>todoList</code> object, my solution is to create another key <code>completeStyle</code> which will return styling for the whole list too by using the <code>item.completed</code> condition.
